    <h1>Welcome to EnergyWatch</h1>

    <p>
      Australians use many electrical appliances every day in their homes.
      These appliances make life easier, more comfortable, and more enjoyable.
      However, they also use electricity, which affects both household costs
      and the environment.
    </p>

    <p>
      EnergyWatch was created to help people better understand how much power
      common appliances use. By learning more about energy use, consumers can
      make smarter choices when buying new products and when using appliances
      at home.
    </p>

    <p>
      This website focuses on televisions sold in Australia. You can explore
      different screen technologies and see how they compare in terms of
      electricity use.

    <p>
      This chart shows the average power use of televisions by screen technology.
      The values are calculated using the mean power consumption for each type.

    <h1>About This Project</h1>

    <p>
      EnergyWatch is a student project developed for the unit COS30045. The aim
      of this website is to present information in a clear and engaging way,
      helping users understand appliance energy use in Australia.
    </p>

    <p>
      The data used in this website comes from the Australian Government energy
      rating register. It contains information about televisions currently sold
      on the Australian market, including brand, model, screen size, and power
      use.
    </p>

    <p>
      This project also demonstrates the use of basic web technologies such as
      HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as data processing using KNIME. All
      content has been reviewed and understood by the author.
