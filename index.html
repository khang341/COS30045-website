    <h1>Welcome to EnergyWatch</h1>
    <p>
      Australians use many electrical appliances every day in their homes.
      These appliances make life easier, more comfortable, and more enjoyable.
      However, they also use electricity, which affects both household costs
      and the environment.
    </p>

    <p>
      EnergyWatch was created to help people better understand how much power
      common appliances use. By learning more about energy use, consumers can
      make smarter choices when buying new products and when using appliances
      at home.
    </p>

    <p>
      This website focuses on televisions sold in Australia. You will be able
      to explore different brands, screen sizes, and technologies, and see how
      they compare in terms of electricity use.

    <h1>Television Energy Use</h1>

    <p>
      Televisions are one of the most common appliances found in Australian
      households. They are used for entertainment, news, education, and gaming.
      Because they are often turned on for many hours each day, their power use
      can make a noticeable difference to yearly electricity bills.
    </p>

    <p>
      Modern televisions come in many different screen sizes and display types.
      Larger screens usually require more power, while newer display technology
      may reduce electricity use. Understanding these differences helps buyers
      choose televisions that suit both their lifestyle and their budget.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this project, official data from the Australian Government is used to
      explore how televisions compare across brands, sizes, and power ratings.
      The goal is to clearly show patterns and relationships in the data.

    <h1>About This Project</h1>

    <p>
      EnergyWatch is a student project developed for the unit COS30045. The aim
      of this website is to present information in a clear and engaging way,
      helping users understand appliance energy use in Australia.
    </p>

    <p>
      The data used in this website comes from the Australian Government energy
      rating register. It contains information about televisions currently sold
      on the Australian market, including brand, model, screen size, and power
      use.
    </p>

      This project also demonstrates the use of basic web technologies such as
      HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as data processing using KNIME. All
