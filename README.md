# Appliance Energy Consumption Website

This project is a small interactive website demonstrating the use of
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and GitHub version control.

## Features
- Three-page navigation using JavaScript
- Styled navigation bar with hover and active states
- Placeholder content related to appliance energy use in Australia
- Hosted using GitHub Pages

## Use of GenAI / Copilot
GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT were used to assist in generating example
HTML structure, CSS styling ideas, and JavaScript navigation logic.

All generated code was reviewed, modified, and fully understood before
being included in this project.

## Reflection
Using GenAI helped speed up development and provided reminders of best
practice structures. However, manual debugging and testing were still
required to ensure correct behaviour and styling.
